<h3>How it works:</h3>
The scheduled script execution "Gather Infoblox Ranges" will gather subnets from Infoblox and dynamically create range sets and schedules (if applicable) for Discovery, depending on the configuration specified on the Properties page within the application.

<h3>How to use</h3>

After installing the application, navigate to Infoblox Integration -> Properties and enter your Infoblox URL and credential details. The other options can be set depending on your needs.
